SAMBA-TOOL(8)                      System Administration tools                      SAMBA-TOOL(8)

NAME
       samba-tool - Main Samba administration tool.

SYNOPSIS
       samba-tool [-h] [-W myworkgroup] [-U user] [-d debuglevel] [--v]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
           Show this help message and exit

       --realm=REALM
           Set the realm name

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind

       --password=PASSWORD
           Password

       -U USERNAME|--username=USERNAME
           Username

       -W WORKGROUP|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Workgroup

       -N|--no-pass
           Don't ask for a password

       -k KERBEROS|--kerberos=KERBEROS
           Use Kerberos

       --ipaddress=IPADDRESS
           IP address of the server

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified
           is 1.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the
           activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will
           be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small
           amount of information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used
           when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers
           and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log level parameter in the
           smb.conf file.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -s|--configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The
           information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap
           file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to
           provide. See smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname" will be appended
           (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the command line. This
           overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the configuration file.

   visualize [options] subcommand
       Produce graphical representations of Samba network state. To work out what is happening in
       a replication graph, it is sometimes helpful to use visualisations.

       There are two subcommands, two graphical modes, and (roughly) two modes of operation with
       respect to the location of authority.

   MODES OF OPERATION
       samba-tool visualize ntdsconn
           Looks at NTDS connections.

       samba-tool visualize reps
           Looks at repsTo and repsFrom objects.

       samba-tool visualize uptodateness
           Looks at replication lag as shown by the uptodateness vectors.

   GRAPHICAL MODES
       --distance
           Distances between DCs are shown in a matrix in the terminal.

       --dot
           Generate Graphviz dot output (for ntdsconn and reps modes). When viewed using dot or
           xdot, this shows the network as a graph with DCs as vertices and connections edges.
           Certain types of degenerate edges are shown in different colours or line-styles.

       --xdot
           Generate Graphviz dot output as with [--dot] and attempt to view it immediately using
           /usr/bin/xdot.

       -r
           Normally, samba-tool talks to one database; with the [-r] option attempts are made to
           contact all the DCs known to the first database. This is necessary for samba-tool
           visualize uptodateness and for samba-tool visualize reps because the repsFrom/To
           objects are not replicated, and it can reveal replication issues in other modes.

   help
       Gives usage information.
